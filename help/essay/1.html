<h1>Js SuperCollider</h1><h2>Binary operators</h2><p>In <em>.js</em> operators are special forms and are not extensible.</p><p>Where in <em>.stc</em> multiplication of two signals is written <em>SinOsc(440, 0) * 0.1</em>,in <em>.js</em> it is written <em>mul(SinOsc(440, 0), 0.1)</em>.</p><p>While the prefix form is required for signal operators the infix forms is allowed for constants,<em>mul(SinOsc([440, 440 * 0.1], 0), [0.1, 0.1 / 2])</em>.</p>
