# Js SuperCollider

## Binary operators

In _.js_ operators are special forms and are not extensible.

Where in _.stc_ multiplication of two signals is written _SinOsc(440, 0) * 0.1_,
in _.js_ it is written _mul(SinOsc(440, 0), 0.1)_.

While the prefix form is required for signal operators the infix forms is allowed for constants,
_mul(SinOsc([440, 440 * 0.1], 0), [0.1, 0.1 / 2])_.
