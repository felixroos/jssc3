<h1>Other Topics</h1><h2>LFPulse vs. Pulse and LFSaw vs. Saw</h2><p>In different situations you will want to use different versions of these unit generators. The <em>LF</em> versions are faster but are not band limited.  That means that they can fold over the Nyquist frequency and cause aliased frequencies. For example here is the same frequency sweep using both kinds of oscillators:</p><p>LFPulse will alias at high frequencies.</p><pre><code>LFPulse(XLn(1000, 8000, 5), 0, 0.1) * 0.2
</code></pre><p>Pulse is band limited and therefore smoother.</p><pre><code>Pulse(XLn(1000, 8000, 5), 0.1) * 0.2
</code></pre><p>Another pair of examples to compare:</p><pre><code>Pulse(SinOsc(0.75, 0) * 5800 + 6000, 0.1) * 0.2
LFPulse(SinOsc(0.75, 0) * 5800 + 6000, 0, 0.1) * 0.2
</code></pre><p>LFPulse is better to use as a low frequency controller because it is truely a rectangular wave.</p><pre><code>Synth.plot({ [LFPulse.ar(1000,0.3,0.7),Pulse.ar(1000,0.3,0.7)] })
</code></pre><p>The same issues apply to Saw and LFSaw.</p><p>LFSaw will alias at high frequencies.</p><pre><code>LFSaw(XLn(1000, 8000, 5), 0) * 0.2
</code></pre><p>Saw is band limited and therefore smoother.</p><pre><code>Saw(XLn(1000, 8000, 5)) * 0.2
</code></pre><p>Another pair of examples to compare :</p><pre><code>Saw(SinOsc(0.75, 0) * 5800 + 6000) * 0.2
LFSaw(SinOsc(0.75, 0) * 5800 + 6000, 0) * 0.2
</code></pre><p>LFSaw is better to use as a low frequency controller because it is truely a sawtooth shape.</p><pre><code>Synth.plot({ [LFSaw(1000,0.7),Saw(1000,0.7)] })
