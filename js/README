Parts of this code are shared between:

1. blksc3 block editor (.xml format)
2. jssc3 plain text editor (.text format)
3. jssc3 rich text editor (.html format)

The common operations are:

1. editor_get_js_notation(), to fetch the .js notation that is to be compiled
2. editor_get_data(), to fetch the storable data from the editor (.xml or .text or .html)
3. editor_set_data(programData), to load stored data into the editor (.xml or .text or .html)

In addition some text editor contexts allow a translation stage, from .stc notation to .js notation.
This translation is handled prior to editor_get_js_notation(), which returns .js notation.
The variable notation_format says which format the user notation is in.
